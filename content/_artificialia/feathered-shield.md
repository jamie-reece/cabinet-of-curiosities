  <p>In his <em>General History of the Things of New Spain</em>, Fray Bernardino de Sahag&#xFA;n (1500&#x2013;90) describes a feathered shield with a fret design at the centre, an attribute, apparently, of Yacatecuhtli, god of traders (<a href="#fig1-ch8">Figure 1</a>).<a id="footnote-040-backlink" href="#footnote-040"><sup>1</sup></a> This design matches those of a pair of feathered shields held in the Landesmuseum of W&#xFC;rttemberg, Germany (<a href="#fig2-ch8">Figures 2</a> and <a href="#fig3-ch8">3</a>). How did they get there? What did Germans make of them?</p>
  <p>What do we know about the ancient Mexican feathered shields? Sources from the 16th century show Aztecs with plain warrior shields for combat, gala shields for feasts or dances and other shields exhibiting the insignia of the supreme war chief. The <em>Codex Mendoza</em>, for example, suggests the <em>xicalcoliuhqui</em> fret ornament shield was for warriors who had captured more than five prisoners and distinguished themselves in battle. Other depictions of the shield are found in the <em>Historia natural de las Indias</em> of Diego Dur&#xE1;n (<a href="#fig4-ch8">Figure 4</a>). These help us understand the various uses of the <em>xicalcoliuhqui</em> shield before the Spanish conquest.</p>

  <p>Both shields held in the Landesmuseum W&#xFC;rttemberg were made before the Spaniards reached Tenochtitlan, the imperial city of the Mexica or Aztecs, and conquered it two years later, in 1521. Once he reached Veracruz in 1519, Hern&#xE1;n Cort&#xE9;s (1485&#x2013;1547) shipped back to Emperor Charles V objects made of jade and silver and richly decorated shields and featherwork as tribute to the Spanish crown. Understood as &#x2018;political gifts&#x2019;, these artefacts helped justify his aims and claims. In addition, war artefacts were esteemed as precious spoils of conquest or as signs of loyal submission. Charles V displayed the precious objects sent by Cort&#xE9;s when celebrating his coronation as Holy Roman emperor in Brussels in 1520. The precious artefacts stirred awe and curiosity among humanist scholars and artists, such as Albrecht D&#xFC;rer (1471&#x2013;1528), who had attended the coronation. D&#xFC;rer recounts that he was left speechless before &#x2018;wonderful things made with great artistry&#x2019; in the &#x2018;golden chamber of the town hall&#x2019;.<a id="footnote-039-backlink" href="#footnote-039"><sup>2</sup></a> There he &#x2018;wondered about the subtle inventiveness of the people of foreign lands&#x2019; who had made them.</p>

  <p>It is unclear if the feathered shields in the Landesmuseum were among the items shipped by Cort&#xE9;s to the Holy Roman emperor and king of Spain. Notably, the museum label displayed at the entrance of the exhibition room where both shields are held presents neither de Sahag&#xFA;n&#x2019;s description of them nor any other 16th-century Mexican source. Instead, the visitor is presented with the account of the diplomat and art collector Philipp Hainhofer (1578&#x2013;1647). Hainhofer had visited the courtly collection of Duke Friedrich I of W&#xFC;rttemberg (reg. 1593&#x2013;1608) in 1616. The account includes the following excerpt:</p>
  <p class="Quotation-in-text">The chamberlain led me into the tower and opened two rooms, inside were two Indian armours, drinking utensils, snails, shells, giant legs, a whole human skin &#x2026; The head of a unicorn, ostrich eggs, turtles, crocodiles, fish and different animals hanging high up in the air &#x2026; In summa, there are so many beautiful things on top of each other that it took a long time to see everything.<a id="footnote-038-backlink" href="#footnote-038"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
  <p>Hainhofer&#x2019;s description of his experience in the Duke&#x2019;s <em>Wunderkammer</em> was typical of the age, when collecting was less about systematic classification and more about assembling a trophy chest of curiosities and wonders. As was common during the period, the duke did not hesitate to display and in some cases gift his treasures to further his diplomatic relations with courts and gentleman scholars. Most notably, the duke decided to parade his feathered shields in tournament dramatisations of &#x2018;the triumphal entry of America&#x2019; (<a href="#fig5-ch8">Figure 5</a>).</p>
  <p>The performative insertion by the duke of the actual shields in a performance likely based upon the Protestant engraving entitled <em>Quae pompa delecta</em> <em>ad Regem deferatur</em>, published by Theodor de Bry in 1591 (<a href="#fig6-ch8">Figure 6</a>), adds a vital element of authenticity otherwise lacking in de Bry&#x2019;s fanciful image.<a id="footnote-037-backlink" href="#footnote-037"><sup>4</sup></a> Here the shields take their place in a symbolic act of Protestant religious war.</p>

  <p>In his chronicle <em>Beschreibung de&#xDF; F&#xFC;rstlichen Apparatus, K&#xF6;niglichen Auffzugs/Heroischen Ingressus und herrlicher Pomp und Solennitet</em>, Jakob Frischlin relates how at the Stuttgart Castle the personification of America made her way towards Protestant Duke Friedrich, in the hope that he would release her from Spanish Catholic subjugation.</p>
  <p>The chronicle tells us that members of the court dressed in elaborate costumes and carried the feathered shields when performing the triumphant entry of &#x2018;Queen America&#x2019;. Dressed in feathers, Queen America gathered together with her sisters, Europa, Asia and Africa. All came expressly to visit and praise Duke Friedrich I in Germany: &#x2018;<em>Und wolt jetzt auch ins Teutschelandt/ Daselbsten ein F&#xFC;rst Hochgeborn/ Zu aller Tugent au&#xDF;erkohrn/ Fridrich so wirdt sein Nahm genandt/ Hertzog von W&#xFC;rtenberger Landt</em>.&#x2019;<a id="footnote-036-backlink" href="#footnote-036"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
  <p>It is likely that the shield was simultaneously intended to evoke in the spectator&#x2019;s mind the image of Aeneas&#x2019;s shield and in so doing presage the glory of the ruling house. The shield made for Aeneas had presaged Rome&#x2019;s future, and it contained propaganda for the Emperor Augustus. It is not by chance that Duke Friedrich I also decided to integrate Daniel&#x2019;s biblical prophecy into the performance through the allegorical personifications of antiquity&#x2019;s universal rulers: Nimrod (Babylon), Cyrus (Persia), Alexander the Great (Greece) and Julius Caesar (Rome). These Old Testament biblical rulers now paid homage to America. Daniel&#x2019;s prophecy was the basis of the &#x2018;Four World Monarchies&#x2019; scheme that had dominated European periodisation and prophecy about the rise and fall of world empires. The Four Monarchies model, as a theological interpretation of history, conceded that powerful earthly kingdoms that fell in moral decay should be replaced by the kingdom of God. This eschatological reading of history was widely deployed by Protestant electoral princes against the Holy Roman emperor&#x2019;s universal imperium, and indeed this reading informs the drawings of de Bry and our unknown artist. This princely discourse promoted a new territorial and Christian order, where the <em>ambitio regnandi</em> of the Catholic rulers would not only be morally admonished but replaced (as Queen America demands from Duke Friedrich I) with good government and true religion under Protestant rule.</p>
  <p>The Protestant deployment of the shields reminds us that collections are far from innocent or static assemblages of dead objects with fixed meanings. And that is why the two shields are still held in a museum in Germany.</p>
