  <p>The <em>b&#xFA;caros</em> or vases of Estremoz (Portugal), Nata (Panama), Chile and Tonal&#xE1; (Guadalajara, Mexico) were earthenware made of clays with extraordinary powers. B&#xFA;caros allowed water inside to evaporate easily while creating a wonderful aroma in the atmosphere. The remaining water in the jug would become refreshingly cold, partaking of the aroma of the special clays. B&#xFA;caros were perfumed humidifiers and systems of water refrigeration. In early modern Portugal, grandees and fashionable urbanites would eat clay (allegedly from Armenia but actually from Estremoz) as pastries wrapped with the seal <em>Sultan</em>. Sultan pastries were morsels that resembled rosary beads. The pastry was made of clay mixed with flour, sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, bergamot oil (extract from the rind of oranges), vanilla, amber and musk. This was the early modern contraceptive pill for the rich and pale. Physicians encouraged patients to eat clay. When ingested baked, it was capable of lowering blood iron levels, causing paleness and stopping menstruation. Brothels had prostitutes ingest Tonal&#xE1; and Estremoz clay for birth control. The Tonal&#xE1; b&#xFA;caros of Guadalajara were even better than those of Estremoz for avoiding pregnancy. It is very likely that the production of b&#xFA;caros was first introduced by Franciscan friars who arrived in the town of Tonal&#xE1; in the wake of Nu&#xF1;o de Guzm&#xE1;n&#x2019;s conquest of Nueva Galicia in 1530. Tonal&#xE1; was the political indigenous centre of the region and the first capital of Nu&#xF1;o de Guzm&#xE1;n&#x2019;s new kingdom. It was also a pre-Hispanic centre of pottery production.</p>

  <p>In Diego Vel&#xE1;zquez&#x2019;s famous palace portrait of the royal family of King Philip IV, today known as <em>Las Meninas</em>, the <em>menina</em> Mar&#xED;a Agustina Sarmiento offers the <em>infanta</em> Margarita a Tonal&#xE1; b&#xFA;caro (<a href="#fig3-ch13">Figure 3</a>). Paleness and amenorrhea were ideal images of female purity in the baroque. The infanta was still a girl. Should we assume the menina wanted the royal heir to drink aromatic water or to avoid future menstrual discharge, or perhaps both?</p>

  <p>The reasons why the duchess of B&#xE9;jar, on the other hand, grabbed a b&#xFA;caro of Estremoz from her dwarf-page &#x2013; as the 1585 painting by S&#xE1;nchez Coello suggests &#x2013; are less clear (<a href="#fig4-ch13">Figure 4</a>).</p>

  <p>The trade of clays from Estremoz and Tonal&#xE1; surfaces in the literature of the golden age. In <em>El acero de Madrid,</em> a <em>comedia</em> published in Madrid in 1611 (and one assumes staged in theatres prior to its publication), Lope de Vega recounts a series of wooing couples, particularly Belisa and Lisardo. Belisa is beautifully pale and anaemic (<em>opilada</em>) because she likes to chew Portuguese clay.</p>
  <p>In 1634, Lope de Vega has Dorothea as another aspiring pale female who is wooed by the poet Fernando and the much older Bela. The Mexican Bela is no match for the dreamy Fernando, Dorothea&#x2019;s true love. But Bela has money, and b&#xFA;caros. Bela eventually dies of his wounds from a fight with Fernando, but he leaves Dorothea the expensive b&#xFA;caros as a token of his affection (<a href="#fig5-ch13">Figure 5</a>).</p>

  <p>Tonal&#xE1;, Nata, Chilean and Estremoz b&#xFA;caros signified early modern wealth in Spain and Portugal and among Iberian elites resident in Italy and Flanders (although one of the largest extant collections of the pots resides today in London at the Victoria and Albert Museum). B&#xFA;caros surfaced repeatedly in early modern still-life paintings as representations of grandee splendour and the aristocratic life of collecting. They also surface in probate records of aristocratic collectors. In eight late 17th-century letters addressed to several members of the Italian nobility, Count Lorenzo Magalotti articulated criteria for collectors. He offered observational and sensory techniques on how to identify the regional varieties of b&#xFA;caros and how to distinguish American from Portuguese ones (<a href="#fig6-ch13">Figure 6</a>).</p>

  <p>Although many Mediterranean nobles collected b&#xFA;caros of Estremoz avidly, the countess of Oca&#xF1;a was one of the most important early modern collectors of b&#xFA;caros of Tonal&#xE1;, as the records of her estate show. Her collection reached into the thousands of items. Her descendant Josefa de la Cerda y Palafox, widow of the count of Oca&#xF1;a, left the National Archaeological Museum of Madrid a collection of only 100 b&#xFA;caros of Tonal&#xE1; in 1885. In 1941, the museum ceded the Tonal&#xE1; b&#xFA;caro collection to the Museum of the Americas, where they can still be found.</p>
  <p>In short, the early modern pill of the nobility was made of clay from Portugal and Mexico. The guardians of their supplies were, in many cases, countesses. Today these early modern pills are stored in exotic ethnography museums.</p>
